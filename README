DESCRIPTION

  This is a screen scanner utility which allows the user to control the mouse
pointer by using the keyboard, the mouse itself, by making physical movements
grabbed by a camera or by producing sounds which are recorded by a microphone.

  This software is a screen scanner utility for people who are not able to use
the mouse whithout a minimum of accuracy. The application makes an horizontal
and a vertical scan of the screen so that the user can reach any location of the
screen and virtually produce any mouse event (click, drag...) in that location.

  The application will offer (so far) these modes to perform the scan:
  - Pressing any key of the keyboard
  - Pressing any button of the mouse
  - Making a certain movement (head or body) by using a webcam
  - Producing a sound by using a microphone

  This software is being developed with C++, Qt4 and OpenCV
